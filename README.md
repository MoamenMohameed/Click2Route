# 🗺️ Click2Route

**Click2Route** is a simple interactive web app that lets users create a route between two points on a map by simply clicking twice.  
It is built using **Leaflet.js** and **Leaflet Routing Machine**, with **OpenStreetMap** as the map data source.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project allows users to generate a route between two points with just two clicks:
- The **first click** sets the starting point.
- The **second click** sets the destination point.
- A **blue line** is automatically drawn between them to show the route.

If the user clicks again after a route has been drawn, the existing route and markers are cleared, allowing a new route to be created.
